      <p>Hello! Welcome to my home page. Let me introduce myself.
      I'm a French software engineer with a PhD in computer science. I received my engineer degree from Ecole Centrale Paris with the "Advanced system" speciality and I defended my PhD in computer science at the Applied Mathematics Laboratory of Ecole Centrale Paris. My thesis advisor was CÃ©line Hudelot.
      The title of my PhD thesis is: "Progressive and Random Accessible Mesh Compression". My research interests included: progressive and random accessible 3D mesh compression, 3D mesh adaptation for transmission and polygonal remeshing. Please have a look at my publications if you are interested in those subjects.
      I am currently doing R&D at Videolabs, the main contributor to VLC media player, the famous multi-platform open source media player. There I'm working on various project, sometimes involving research.
      Disclaimer: I am not a native English speaker. So, please excuse the mistakes on this web site. ;-)
